# OECD Dataset Download Automation

This project automates the extraction, comparison, and storage of updated/inserted OECD dataset information, leveraging APIs and structured workflows. 

## Features
- **Data Fetching:** Downloads dataflows from the OECD API.
- **Data Comparison:** Compares new datasets with previous instances to detect changes (new inserts, deletions).
- **Data Management:** Saves dataset and metadata for future processing.
- **Change Archival:** Archives previous datasets and records changes for future reference.
- **Error Logging:** Logs detailed information about the execution process.

## File Structure
- **`Functions/`:** Contains core utility scripts:
  - `data_fetcher.py`: Fetches dataflows and saves them to Excel. Designed for first time dataset download as well as subsequent downloads (`all_dataflows_new.xlsx`, `all_dataflows_previous.xlsx`)
  - `data_comparator.py`: Compares old `all_dataflows_previous.xlsx` and new datasets `all_dataflows_new.xlsx` and identifies changes `data_changes.xlsx`.
  - `api_downloader.py`: Downloads datasets and metadata for new entries.
  - `logger.py`: Configures logging for the project.
- **`base_run.py`:** Initializes and manages the data fetching workflow for the first time to create Base dataset.
- **`main.py`:** Invokes regular workflows, including data fetching, comparison, and metadata updates. This is to be scheduled and invoked on regular intervals
- **`config.yaml`:** Configuration file with API endpoints, file names and file paths.
- **`requirements.txt`:** Lists Python dependencies.

## Folder Requirements
Ensure the following folders exist in the project directory before running the scripts:
1. **`logs/`:**  
   - Used for storing log files generated by the scripts.
2. **`output/`:**  
   - Used for saving downloaded datasets and metadata files.
3. **`data/`:**  
   - Used for storing the main dataset files (e.g., `all_dataflows_new.xlsx`, `all_dataflows_previous.xlsx`, `data_changes.xlsx`).
4. **`data/archive/` :**  
   - Folder for archiving old datasets or backups .
